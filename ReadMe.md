## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to Docker Hardened Images (DHI) in your Docker Hub namespace

### Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dhi-migration.git
cd dhi-migration
chmod +x dhi_migrate.py
```

No additional dependencies required - uses only Python standard library!

## üéØ Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python dhi_migrate.py <dockerfile_path> <dhi_image> [options]
```

**Required Arguments:**
- `dockerfile_path`: Path to your original Dockerfile
- `dhi_image`: The DHI image to use (e.g., `myorg/dhi-node:18-dev`)

### Advanced Options

| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--output`, `-o` | Output file path | `-o production.dockerfile` |
| `--namespace`, `-n` | Docker Hub namespace | `-n myorganization` |
| `--verbose`, `-v` | Show detailed migration notes | `-v` |
| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing | `--dry-run` |

### Examples

#### Migrate a Node.js Application
```bash
# Basic migration
python dhi_migrate.py Dockerfile myorg/dhi-node:18-dev

# With custom output and verbose logging
python dhi_migrate.py Dockerfile myorg/dhi-node:18-dev \
  --output dhi.dockerfile \
  --verbose
```

#### Migrate a Python Application
```bash
python dhi_migrate.py Dockerfile myorg/dhi-python:3.11-dev \
  --output secure.dockerfile
```

#### Migrate a Go Application
```bash
# Go applications often get optimized to use static images
python dhi_migrate.py Dockerfile myorg/dhi-golang:1.21-dev \
  --verbose
```

#### Preview Changes (Dry Run)
```bash
python dhi_migrate.py Dockerfile myorg/dhi-node:18-dev --dry-run
```

## üîß How It Works

The migration tool follows Docker's official DHI migration guidelines:

### 1. **Base Image Replacement**
```dockerfile
# Before
FROM node:18

# After  
FROM myorg/dhi-node:18-dev AS build-stage
```

### 2. **Multi-stage Build Creation**
When package managers or build tools are detected, creates optimized multi-stage builds:

```dockerfile
# Build stage - with dev tools
FROM myorg/dhi-node:18-dev AS build-stage
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# Runtime stage - minimal image
FROM myorg/dhi-node:18 AS runtime-stage
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build-stage --chown=nonroot:nonroot /app /app
USER nonroot
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### 3. **Security Hardening**
- **Non-root User**: Configures applications to run as `nonroot` user
- **Port Security**: Adjusts privileged ports (<1024) to safe alternatives
- **Exec Form**: Converts shell form commands to exec form for proper signal handling
- **File Permissions**: Ensures proper ownership with `--chown` flags

### 4. **Smart Optimizations**
- **Go Applications**: Uses `docker/dhi-static` for compiled binaries
- **Package Management**: Moves `apt-get`, `yum`, `apk`, `pip` to build stages
- **TLS Certificates**: Leverages built-in certificates in DHI images

## üìñ Migration Guidelines

### Before Migration
1. **Access DHI Images**: Ensure you have access to DHI images in your namespace
2. **Review Current Dockerfile**: Understand your application's dependencies
3. **Backup Original**: Keep a copy of your original Dockerfile

### DHI Image Naming Convention
- **Build Images**: Use `-dev` suffix (e.g., `myorg/dhi-node:18-dev`)
- **Runtime Images**: No suffix (e.g., `myorg/dhi-node:18`)
- **Static Images**: For compiled binaries (`docker/dhi-static:20241121`)

### After Migration
1. **Test Thoroughly**: Build and run the migrated image
2. **Check Permissions**: Verify file access with non-root user
3. **Update Port Mappings**: Adjust port mappings if ports were changed
4. **Monitor Performance**: Ensure application performs as expected

## üîç Understanding the Output

The tool generates a new Dockerfile with:

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile migrated to Docker Hardened Images (DHI)
# Generated by DHI Migration Tool on 2024-06-11 15:30:45
# 
# Migration Notes:
# - Updated to use minimal, security-focused DHI base images
# - Configured to run as non-root user for enhanced security
# - Ports adjusted to avoid privilege requirements where needed
# - Multi-stage build implemented to reduce attack surface
```

### Migration Log Examples
```
‚Ä¢ Replaced base image: FROM node:18 -> FROM myorg/dhi-node:18-dev
‚Ä¢ Changed privileged port 80 to 8080
‚Ä¢ Converted to exec form: CMD node server.js -> CMD ["node", "server.js"]
‚Ä¢ Moved package installation to build stage
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Permission Denied Errors
```bash
# Problem: Application can't write files
# Solution: Ensure directories are owned by nonroot user
RUN mkdir -p /app/logs && chown -R nonroot:nonroot /app/logs
```

#### Port Binding Issues
```bash
# Problem: Can't bind to port < 1024
# Solution: Use higher ports or configure port mapping
# Tool automatically suggests: EXPOSE 8080  # Changed from 80
```

#### Missing Dependencies
```bash
# Problem: Runtime image missing packages
# Solution: Multi-stage build copies dependencies correctly
COPY --from=build-stage /app/node_modules ./node_modules
```

#### Signal Handling Problems
```bash
# Problem: Container doesn't stop gracefully
# Solution: Tool converts to exec form automatically
CMD ["node", "server.js"]  # Instead of: CMD node server.js
```

### Getting Help

1. **Run with `--verbose`**: See detailed migration notes
2. **Use `--dry-run`**: Preview changes before applying
3. **Check Docker Logs**: `docker logs <container_id>`
4. **Use Docker Debug**: For troubleshooting DHI containers

## üß™ Testing Your Migration

### Build and Test Process
```bash
# 1. Build the migrated image
docker build -f dhi.dockerfile -t myapp:dhi .

# 2. Test basic functionality
docker run --rm myapp:dhi

# 3. Test with port mapping
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 myapp:dhi

# 4. Test file permissions
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data myapp:dhi

# 5. Test in production-like environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dhi.yml up
```

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Image builds successfully
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Non-root user can access required files
- [ ] Network connectivity works
- [ ] Port mappings function correctly
- [ ] Graceful shutdown works (SIGTERM handling)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always test migrated Dockerfiles thoroughly in your staging environment before deploying to production. DHI migration can change application behavior, especially around file permissions and port bindings.

**üîê Security Note**: This tool helps improve your container security posture, but security is a continuous process. Regularly update your DHI base images and monitor for security advisories.
